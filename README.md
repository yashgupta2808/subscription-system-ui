## About the Project

This project is a subscription system built using Next.js. It provides a user interface for managing subscriptions.

## How It Works

The subscription system allows users to:
- Get a new subscription
- Cancel the existing subscription
- Renew the expired subscription

The system uses Next.js for the frontend, providing a fast and responsive user experience.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
