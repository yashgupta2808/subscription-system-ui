## About the Project

This project is a subscription system built using Next.js. It provides a user interface for managing subscriptions. It is deployed on AWS Amplify via console. The backend of this project can be found here: [subscription-system-service](https://github.com/yashgupta2808/subscription-system-service)

## How It Works

The subscription system allows users to:

- Sign up and verify their email via invitation code
- Sign in to their account
- Get a new subscription for a month
- Cancel the existing subscription
- Renew the expired subscription

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
